My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

Over the next year, I aim to grow both personally and academically. My main academic goal is to start college in civil engineering. 
Personally, I want to become more disciplined, build better learning habits, and start working on real projects 
that align with my long-term goal of solving climate-related problems using tech. Iâ€™m focused on learning by 
doing, staying consistent, and leveling up every step of the way with the help of GOD.
