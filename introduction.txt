                                        Brief Introduction About Myself

Hi, I’m Ahmad Shyaka an aspiring learner currently exploring the world of Linux and version control through the ALX pathway program. 
I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, and I’m on a journey to build a strong foundation in systems, 
tools, and workflows that power modern development. 
This repository marks my first step into Git and GitHub, where I’ll be tracking my progress, learning milestones, and hands on exercises.
